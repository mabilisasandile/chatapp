# React + Vite Chat Web App

I created a full-stack chat application using React JS and Firebase. This chat app allows users to create an account and chat with their friends in real-time. Additionally, users can send images within the chat.

For authentication, I utilized Firebase, and chat images are stored in Cloudinary. The chat messages are stored in the Firestore Database, enabling real-time message delivery.
